## 📚 Learning Resources

The CSES Problem Set is designed to complement competitive programming textbooks:

- **Competitive Programming 4** by Steven Halim
- **Guide to Competitive Programming** by Antti Laaksonen
- **Competitive Programmer's Handbook** by Antti Laaksonen

Visit the [CSES book recommendations](https://cses.fi/book/index.php) for the complete list.

## 🔍 Solution Format

Each solution includes:

- **Problem statement link**
- **Algorithm explanation**
- **Time and space complexity**
- **Clean, commented code**
- **Test cases (where applicable)**

Example:
```cpp
/*
Problem: Weird Algorithm
Link: https://cses.fi/problemset/task/1068
Time Complexity: O(log n)
Space Complexity: O(1)

Algorithm:
- Follow the Collatz conjecture steps
- If n is even: n = n/2
- If n is odd: n = 3n + 1
- Continue until n = 1
*/
```

## 🏆 Hacking System

CSES features a unique **hacking system**:
- After solving a problem, view other users' solutions
- Try to find test cases that break their solutions
- Successful hacks improve the test suite for everyone
- All submissions are regraded with new test cases
